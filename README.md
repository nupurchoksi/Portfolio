It includes sections like Home, About Me, Education, Skills, Projects, and Contact.

## Approach
- Built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** from scratch.  
- Designed the website to be **simple, clean, and professional**.  
- Ensured the layout is **responsive** and works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.  
- Added interactive features like **hover effects and smooth scroll animations**.  
- Deployed the website using **GitHub Pages** for free hosting.

## Challenges Faced
- Understanding and implementing **responsive design** for different screen sizes.  
- Making JavaScript-based sections (like smooth scroll & navigation) work properly without breaking other parts.  
- Organizing all sections (Home, Education, Skills, Projects) in a structured way.  
- Hosting and publishing the project on GitHub Pages for the first time.
